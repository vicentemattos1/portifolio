      "description": "Experienced Full Stack Developer skilled in creating and implementing scalable and responsive web applications, closely collaborating with back-end teams to ensure efficient integration between front-end components and external systems, focusing on comprehensive solutions that meet user needs. On the Frontend, my primary technology is ReactJS, complemented by TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Redux, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS to create efficient interfaces, prioritizing performance and user experience. On the Backend, I have experience with Python and Django, as well as working with databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Prisma, and MongoDB, also utilizing containerization practices with Docker.\n \n I adopt microfrontend practices to ensure more efficient and scalable code maintenance. In projects where VueJS is the best choice, I apply this framework along with tools like Vuetify and Storybook to promote visual consistency and facilitate the development of reusable components. I am also studying the implementation of deployment automation processes with CI/CD using Bitbucket and the execution of automated tests with Vitest and Jest, aiming to optimize the development cycle.\n \n My approach is focused on ensuring high performance of interfaces and smooth user interaction. I actively participate in code reviews, promoting best practices and ensuring the quality of delivered code, as well as maintaining clear and accessible technical documentation, facilitating team collaboration. I also contribute to requirements analysis and prototyping of new projects, offering technical and architectural solutions that meet business demands.\n \n I adopt agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban, using tools like Taiga, Bitbucket/GitHub, and Jira for task management and efficient team communication. I work collaboratively with the QA team, ensuring code quality through reviews, tests, and validations. Always seeking innovation, my goal is to deliver scalable and efficient solutions aligned with business needs and end users."
