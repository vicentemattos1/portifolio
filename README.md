## Hi, my name is Vicente Mattos and this is my portfolio

## I spent one day to do this project

# Phase 1, planning:

## Question 1: What libraries I'll use to build this?

### Most part os the libraries used for this project was decided to make the development faster and with good UX, without impact future maintenance and performance.

## Question 2: For what reason I'm going to use React?

### I've been working with React for a couple years, so this is my best tech. For this project, since this is a simple application, I just followed my hearth. For a bigger application would be necessary a study to know what tech would be the best.

## Questions 3: From where the design came from?

### I followed the design from this link:

### Based on this UI, I made my own modifications for mobile and desktop

# Phase 3, self-critique & scaling

## What I would do to improve this project

### Integrate with backend to share quick new functionalities that I discovered

### Add animations for a better UX

## What are the most develop items for this project

### I used MUI(Accordion, Box, Typography, Stack, Select, MenuItem, Drawer) and i18n
